title: Coding guidelines
description: A set of coding style guidelines that you should adhere to whenever possible.

BotW has 40MB of code and contributors need to read and modify existing parts of the codebase very often: inconsistencies lead to increased mental overhead and a loss of efficiency which we cannot afford considering our limited manpower.

That is why we have a set of coding style guidelines that contributors are expected to adhere to.

To reduce the amount of time wasted on formatting issues, we use [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to automatically enforce a consistent coding style. We also use [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) to detect common style issues, programming errors, and error prone code.

All pull requests are run through clang-format and clang-tidy and must pass both before they can be merged.

Before opening a PR, please format your code with clang-format 12+ and ensure the following guidelines are followed. That will allow your contributions to be reviewed more quickly.

## Code style

The most important rule: look around and follow the existing code style (formatting, source organisation, ...) when possible.

### General

* Lines should not be longer than 100 characters.
* Use 4 spaces to indent.
* Use `nullptr`, not `NULL` or `0`.
* Only use `auto` if the variable type is obvious, too long to type or if it doesn't matter.
* To compare an integer against zero, write `if (value == 0)`, not `if (!value)`. (This rule doesn't apply to booleans.)
* To compare a value against nullptr, either `if (pointer != nullptr)` or `if (pointer)` is fine.
* Avoid useless parentheses:
    * :heavy_check_mark: `if (x == Type::String || x == Type::Int)`
    * :x: `if ((x == Type::String) || (x == Type::Int))`
        <br /> Parens are just noise here: most people (especially anyone who has worked on a software project) are used to the lack of parentheses.
    * :heavy_check_mark: `if ((foo && bar) || (x && y))`
    * :x: `if (foo && bar || x && y)`
        <br /> While parentheses are technically useless here, most people do not know their operator precedence for && and || by heart, so it's better to just add parens to make it clear what is being meant.
* Avoid `using namespace` at namespace/global scope.
* Declare variables close to their usage point: C89 style declarations are an unnecessary antipattern in any modern language and discouraged.

### Header files

* Use `#pragma once` for header guards.
* Avoid unnecessary includes. Forward declare types when possible to reduce compilation times.

### Includes

* Use `#include "..."` when including U-King (BotW) header files. KingSystem (ksys) is treated as being part of BotW.
    * Include paths should be relative to src/.
        * :heavy_check_mark: `#include "KingSystem/ActorSystem/actActor.h"`
        * :x: `#include "actActor.h"`

* Use `#include <...>` for system or library includes. Examples:
    * Standard C++ library headers (e.g. `<optional>`, `<type_traits>`, `<limits>`, ...)
    * sead (e.g. `<prim/seadSafeString.h>`)
    * Other Nintendo libraries like agl, evfl, eui, ...

### Naming

* Type names (classes/structs, enums, typedefs/alias declarations) and compile-time constants should be in UpperCamelCase.
    * `class ActorInfoData`
    * `using Manager = ksys::gdt::Manager;`
    * `constexpr int NumActors = 42;`

* Function names should be in camelCase.
    * `void doStuff()`
    * `void SomeClass::doThis()` (for a member function)

* Variables should be in lowercase_snake_case, except for class member variables, which should be prefixed with 'm' and writtenLikeThis.
    * `int a_dummy_variable = 42;`
    * `void test(int first_argument, bool second_argument) { ... }`
    * `class SomeClass { int mMemberVariable; };` (m prefix + camelCase)
    * `struct SomeStruct { int member_variable; };` (regular snake_case)

* Static variables should be prefixed with 's' and globals with 'g'.
    * `s_static_variable`
    * `sStaticVariable` if it's a static member variable

### Classes
* Ordering
   * Put access specifiers in this order: `public`, `protected`, `private`.
   * Declare member functions in this order: constructor, destructor, operators, other member functions.
   * Declare non-static member variables after function declarations.
   * Declare static member variables before non-static variables.
   * Virtual functions need to match the original order in the executable, though, so ignore this rule if following it would require reordering virtual functions.
* If a class uses a macro like `SEAD_SINGLETON_DISPOSER` or one of the SEAD_RTTI macros, put the macro right after the opening brace, before `public:`.
* Use `= default;` instead of constructors/destructors with an empty body.
* Use the `override` keyword instead of `virtual` when overriding virtual functions from a parent class.
* Mark member functions as const if they do not modify any non-static member variables. (This is known as const correctness.)
* Do not use `this->` to refer to member variables or member functions unless it is necessary. (It is usually unnecessary.)

```cpp
#pragma once

namespace foo {

class Test {
    SEAD_RTTI_BASE(Test)

public:
    Test();
    virtual ~Test() = default;
    virtual bool isTest() const { return true; }
    void doStuff() {}

private:
    static bool sFoo = false;
    bool mMemberVariable = true;
};

class TestDerived : public Test {
public:
    bool isTest() const override { return true; }
};

}  // namespace foo
```

(Notice the line breaks on the namespace opening and closing lines.)
